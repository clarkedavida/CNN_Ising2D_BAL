# CNN_Ising2D_BAL

We studied the effect of example size on the output layer of
a CNN trained to classify phases of the 2-$d$ Ising model.
Here we collect our CNN. The architecture is our best
understanding of the architecture presented in 
Appendix B of [2004.14341](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14341)
by [D. Bachtis](https://github.com/dbachtis),
G. Aarts, and B. Lucini.

This implementation by [A. Abuali](https://github.com/SabryPhys) utilizes 
[Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and 
[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) with 
[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).
